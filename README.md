# my_projects

I have made two projects using python.
Password checker, which is really useful in daily lives to check whether our password has ever been pwned.I have used hashed passwords to check so we dont have to be worried about our safety measures, we wont  be sending our original passwords anywhere to check. I have also used requests module to get the urls for hashing the passwords.
The other one is webscraping, which is useful for sorting out the data we need from the websites.
